(use case driven dev - make it up as I need it)

use V8 Javascript, only node.js if it seems to simplify things

resource.in is where you make a request
resource.out is where the response comes from?

working = "~/working" ; base dir for working files

data = turtle("file.ttl")
data contains that data and the marker that it's "Accept: text/turtle"



or 

a.in = t.out
v.in = a.out

show(v.out)

t.out is the response from doing a GET on t
t.out@html  is the response from doing a GET on t with "Accept: HTML media types"
